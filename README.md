- üîÑ **Repeat Playback**: Set custom repeat counts for sequences
- üé® **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark theme for comfortable use
- üìå **Always on Top**: Enhanced window priority to stay visible over games
- üñ•Ô∏è **macOS Native**: Optimized for macOS with full system integration

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- macOS 11.0 or later
- CMake 3.16 or later
- Qt 6.7.3
- Xcode Command Line Tools

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m9dful1/Craftium.git
   cd Craftium
   ```

2. **Install Qt** (using Homebrew)
   ```bash
   brew install qt@6
   ```

3. **Create build directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

4. **Configure and build**
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./Craftium
   ```

### Build Configuration

The project uses CMake with the following features:
- C++17 standard
- Objective-C++ support for macOS integration
- Qt6 Widgets, Core, and Gui modules
- Native macOS frameworks: CoreGraphics, Carbon, AppKit

## CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated builds:

### Continuous Builds
- Triggered on every push to `main`/`master`
- Creates a "continuous" release with the latest build
- DMG files are available for download immediately

### Release Builds
- Triggered when creating a new release tag
- Builds are automatically attached to the release
- Use semantic versioning for tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

### Creating a Release

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Then create a release on GitHub using that tag, and the build will automatically attach.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Main Window**: Qt6 Widgets-based UI
- **Recording**: Platform-specific global keyboard hooks
  - macOS: CGEventTap with Accessibility permissions
  - Windows: Low-level keyboard hooks
- **Playback**: Worker thread for non-blocking execution
- **Thread Safety**: QMutex protection for sequence data

### Enhanced Features

- **Always on Top**: Uses `NSFloatingWindowLevel` on macOS for maximum window priority
- **Thread-Safe**: All sequence operations protected with mutex locks
- **Non-Blocking UI**: Playback runs on dedicated worker thread

## Troubleshooting

### Recording doesn't work
- Ensure Accessibility permissions are granted
- Try restarting the application
- On macOS: System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility

### Playback doesn't work in target app
- Ensure the target application is in focus before playback starts
- For games, try borderless windowed mode instead of fullscreen
- Some applications may block simulated input

### Window not staying on top
- Ensure "Always on Top" checkbox is enabled
- Try toggling it off and back on
- Some fullscreen applications may override window levels
