## ⏱️ Build Timeline

A typical successful build takes approximately **8-12 minutes**:

| Step | Duration | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Setup | ~30s | Checkout code, prepare environment |
| Install Qt | ~3-4 min | Download and install Qt 6.7.3 (cached after first run) |
| Configure CMake | ~10s | Generate build files |
| Build | ~2-3 min | Compile C++ code, link frameworks |
| Create DMG | ~1-2 min | Package app bundle, run macdeployqt |
| Upload | ~30s | Upload artifacts and create release |

## 📊 Build Status Indicators

### In Progress 🟡
```
⏳ Workflow is running
```
The build is currently executing. Check back in ~10 minutes.

### Success ✅
```
✓ Workflow completed successfully
```
Your DMG is ready! Download from the Continuous Release page.

### Failed ❌
```
✗ Workflow failed
```
Click on the failed run to see error logs. Common issues:
- Qt installation problems (now fixed!)
- Compilation errors in code
- Missing dependencies

## 🔍 Monitoring Your Build

### Step 1: Check Actions Tab
1. Visit: https://github.com/m9dful1/Craftium/actions
2. Look for the latest "Continuous Build" workflow
3. Click on it to see detailed progress

### Step 2: Watch the Steps
You'll see each step execute in order:
- ✅ Checkout code
- ✅ Install Qt (this is the longest step)
- ✅ Create build directory
- ✅ Configure CMake
- ✅ Build
- ✅ Create DMG
- ✅ Upload artifacts
- ✅ Create or Update Continuous Release

### Step 3: Download Your Build

**Option A: From Continuous Release**
1. Go to: https://github.com/m9dful1/Craftium/releases/tag/continuous
2. Under "Assets", download `Craftium-macOS-[date]-[sha].dmg`

**Option B: From Workflow Artifacts**
1. Go to the completed workflow run
2. Scroll to the bottom - "Artifacts" section
3. Download the build artifact

## 🐛 Common Build Failures

### Qt Installation Failed
**Symptoms**: Build fails at "Install Qt" step
**Cause**: Invalid module names or version not available
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (removed invalid modules parameter)

### CMake Configuration Failed
**Symptoms**: Build fails at "Configure CMake" step
**Cause**: Syntax error in CMakeLists.txt
**Fix**: Check the error log for the specific line

### Compilation Failed
**Symptoms**: Build fails at "Build" step
**Cause**: Code syntax errors or missing dependencies
**Fix**: Check error log for file and line number

### DMG Creation Failed
**Symptoms**: Build fails at "Create DMG" step
**Cause**: macdeployqt can't find Qt libraries
**Fix**: Ensure Qt was installed correctly

## 📦 What Gets Built

Each successful build creates:

1. **DMG File** (macOS Disk Image)
   - Contains: `Craftium.app` bundle
   - Includes: All Qt dependencies
   - Size: ~15-20 MB
   - Universal Binary: Runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon

2. **Raw Executable** (for debugging)
   - File: `Craftium`
   - Needs Qt installed on system to run
   - Useful for development/testing

## 🎯 Next Build Will...

After you push the fix commit, the next build should:

1. ✅ Successfully install Qt 6.7.3
2. ✅ Configure CMake without errors
3. ✅ Compile all source files
4. ✅ Create a working DMG file
5. ✅ Upload to the continuous release

**Estimated completion time**: ~10 minutes from push

## 🔄 Build Triggers

Builds are automatically triggered when you:
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Create a pull request
- Create a new release tag

## 📱 Getting Notified

To get email notifications for build status:
1. Go to: https://github.com/m9dful1/Craftium
2. Click "Watch" → "Custom"
3. Select "Actions" under "Workflow runs"
4. Click "Apply"

Now you'll get emails when builds succeed or fail!
